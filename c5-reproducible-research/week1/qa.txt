Q2. Which of the following is a requirement for a published data analysis to be reproducible?

The full computer code for doing the data analysis is made publicly available.

Q6. What is the role of processing code in the research pipeline?

It transforms the measured data into analytic data.

Q7. Which is a goal of literate statistical programming?
