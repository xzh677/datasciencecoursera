Q4. If I execute the expression x <- 4L in R, what is the class of the object `x' as determined by the `class()' function?

integer

Q5. What is the class of the object defined by the expression x <- c(4, "a", TRUE)?

character


Q6. If I have two vectors x <- c(1,3, 5) and y <- c(3, 2, 10), what is produced by the expression cbind(x, y)?

a matrix with 2 columns and 3 rows


Q7. A key property of vectors in R is that

elements of a vector all must be of the same class


Q8. Suppose I have a list defined as x <- list(2, "a", "b", TRUE). What does x[[2]] give me? Select all that apply.

a character vector containing the letter "a".

a character vector of length 1.

an integer vector with the values 3, 5, 5, 7.


Q10. Suppose I have a vector x <- c(17, 14, 4, 5, 13, 12, 10) and I want to set all elements of this vector that are greater than 10 to be equal to 4. What R code achieves this? Select all that apply.

x[x > 10] <- 4


data <- read.csv("hw1_data.csv")



Q11. In the dataset provided for this Quiz, what are the column names of the dataset?

data[1,]

Ozone, Solar.R, Wind, Temp, Month, Day

Q12. Extract the first 2 rows of the data frame and print them to the console. What does the output look like?

data[1:2,]

  Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day
1    41     190  7.4   67     5   1
2    36     118  8.0   72     5   2

Q13. How many observations (i.e. rows) are in this data frame?

dim(data)[1]

153

Q14. Extract the last 2 rows of the data frame and print them to the console. What does the output look like?

len <- dim(data)[1]
data[(len - 1):len,]

    Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day
152    18     131  8.0   76     9  29
153    20     223 11.5   68     9  30


Q15. What is the value of Ozone in the 47th row?
data[47,]$Ozone
21

Q16. How many missing values are in the Ozone column of this data frame?
table(is.na(data$Ozone))
37

Q17. What is the mean of the Ozone column in this dataset? Exclude missing values (coded as NA) from this calculation.
mean(data[!bad, ]$Ozone)
42.129

Q18.Extract the subset of rows of the data frame where Ozone values are above 31 and Temp values are above 90. What is the mean of Solar.R in this subset?

ozoneAbove31 = data$Ozone > 31
tempAbove90 = data$Temp > 90
filter = ozoneAbove31 & tempAbove90
filter[is.na(filter)] <- F
mean(data[filter,]$Solar.R)
212.8

Q19. What is the mean of "Temp" when "Month" is equal to 6?

filter = data$Month == 6
mean(data[filter,]$Temp)
79.1

Q20. What was the maximum ozone value in the month of May (i.e. Month is equal to 5)?
filter = data$Month == 5
data[is.na(data$Ozone), ]$Ozone <- 0
max(data[filter, ]$Ozone)
