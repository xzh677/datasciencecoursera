Q1. 
Which of the following are components in building a machine learning algorithm?

Creating features.

Q2. 
Suppose we build a prediction algorithm on a data set and it is 100% accurate on that data set. Why might the algorithm not work well if we collect a new data set?

Our algorithm may be overfitting the training data, predicting both the signal and the noise.

Q3.
What are typical sizes for the training and test sets?

80% training set, 20% test set

Q4. What are some common error rates for predicting binary variables (i.e. variables with two possible values like yes/no, disease/normal, clicked/didn't click)? Check the correct answer(s).

Predictive value of a positive

Q5. Suppose that we have created a machine learning algorithm that predicts whether a link will be clicked with 99% sensitivity and 99% specificity. The rate the link is clicked is 1/1000 of visits to a website. If we predict the link will be clicked on a specific visit, what is the probability it will actually be clicked?

9%
